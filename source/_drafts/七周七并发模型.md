# Parallel Architecture
## Bit-Level Parallelism
> That’s why the history of computing has seen us move from 8- to 16-, 32-, and now 64-bit architectures. The total amount of benefit we’ll see from this kind of parallelism has its limits, though, which is why we’re unlikely to see 128-bit computers soon.

## Instruction-Level Parallelism
> Modern CPUs are highly parallel, using techniques like pipelining, out-of-order execution, and speculative execution.

## Data Parallelism
> 图像处理，GPU

## Task-Level Parallelism

# seven models
## 1. Threads and locks
### Alien Methods问题

## 2. Functional programming
> 核心：Eliminate mutable state, functional programs are intrinsically thread-safe and easily parallelized

accumulator是mutable对象
``` java
public int sum(int[] numbers) {
  int accumulator = 0;
  for (int n: numbers)
  	accumulator += n;
  return accumulator;
}
```

> Clojure版本，通过递归避免了使用mutable对象
``` Clojure
(defn recursive-sum [numbers]
    (if(empty ? numbers) 
      0
    (+ (first numbers) (recursive-sum(rest numbers)))))
```


## 3. The Clojure Way
> separating identity and state: The Clojure language has popularized a particularly effective hybrid of imperative and functional programming, allowing the strengths of both approaches to be leveraged in concert.

## 4. Actors
>  The actor model is a general-purpose concurrent programming model with particularly wide applicability. It can target both shared- and distributed-memory architectures and facilitate geographical distribution, and it provides particularly strong support for fault tolerance and resilience

## 5. Communicating Sequential Processes(CSP)
> On the face of things, Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) has much in common with the actor model, both being based on message passing. Its emphasis on the channels used for communication, rather than the entities between which communication takes place, leads to CSP-based programs having a very different flavor, however

## 6. Data parallelism

## 7. The Lambda Architecture
> The Lambda Architecture combines the strengths of MapReduce and stream processing to create an architecture that can tackle a wide variety of Big Data problems
